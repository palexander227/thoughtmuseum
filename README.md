# Thoughtmuseum (Work Spaces)

## Description

Thoughtmuseum.com is a standalone professional web application for online educators. This application is intended to be included as a module within that website.

This application acts in much the same way as Google classroom. Instructors can generate workspaces they can use to exchange information and comments with their students. Students can log in, post questions and carry on asynchronous dialog with their instructors.

## Disclaimer

This project is still in the early stages of development and a further, more detailed and complete explanation of the features here are still in progress.
